title: Severing of undersea data cables in the Baltic Sea

The incident involving the Chinese cargo ship Yi Peng 3 and the severing of undersea data cables in the Baltic Sea has raised significant suspicions and concerns about potential sabotage, with many Western officials believing that Russia was likely behind the incident.

Here are the key points:

## Investigation and Evidence

- The Chinese-flagged bulk carrier, Yi Peng 3, departed from Russia's Ust-Luga port on the Baltic Sea on November 15, carrying Russian fertilizer. During its journey, the ship dragged its anchor over the Baltic seabed for more than 100 miles, severing two critical undersea data cables. The first cable connected Sweden and Lithuania, and the second was the only communications cable linking Finland with Germany\[1]\[2]\[3].

## Suspicions of Sabotage

- The actions of Yi Peng 3 have been deemed highly suspicious, as it is nearly impossible for a ship to sever not just one but two cables by accident, especially given that these cables are meticulously detailed on navigational charts\[2].
- Germanyâ€™s defense minister, Boris Pistorius, has described the incidents as "hybrid aggression" and "sabotage," reflecting the widespread belief among Western officials that the damage was intentional\[2].

## Russian Involvement

- Western officials suspect that Russian intelligence agencies orchestrated the incident. The origin of the ship's departure from a Russian port and the timing of the incident, which comes amid ongoing tensions related to the war in Ukraine, have contributed to these suspicions\[1]\[2]\[3].
- Despite these accusations, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has denied Russian involvement, calling the accusations "absurd"\[1].

## Chinese Cooperation

- China is cooperating with the investigation, with the Chinese foreign ministry confirming diplomatic dialogue with relevant parties, including Denmark. The ship's owner, Ningbo Yipeng Shipping, has also allowed the vessel to be stopped for further investigation\[1].

## Broader Context

- This incident is not the first time a Chinese merchant vessel has been implicated in damaging undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. A similar incident occurred in October 2023 involving the container ship Newnew Polar Bear, which also left a Russian port before the damage occurred\[2].

In summary, while the Chinese ship Yi Peng 3 is under investigation for the sabotage, Western officials strongly believe that Russia was behind the incident, highlighting concerns about hybrid warfare and the vulnerability of critical undersea infrastructure.
