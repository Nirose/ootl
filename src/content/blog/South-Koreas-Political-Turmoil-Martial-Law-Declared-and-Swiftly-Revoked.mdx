## Martial law declared

In a dramatic turn of events, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law on December 3, 2024, citing threats from "North Korean communist forces" and internal "antistate forces" as the primary reasons for this drastic measure. The announcement, made via a televised address, has plunged the nation into political uncertainty and global scrutiny.

The declaration saw armed soldiers swiftly taking control of the National Assembly, with troops entering the building in a bold show of force. Helicopters were reported landing on the assembly's roof, and troops broke in through a window, highlighting the severity of the situation ([AP News](https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-martial-law-997c22ac93f6a9bece68454597e577c1)). This move was perceived as an escalation in the ongoing tensions between Yoon's conservative People Power Party and the opposition Democratic Party, which holds a commanding majority in the legislative body.

## Demanding the immediate lifting of martial law

Despite the president's drastic action, the National Assembly quickly convened to pass a resolution demanding the immediate lifting of martial law. Under Article 77 of the South Korean Constitution, such a resolution by the assembly obliges the president to comply ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/03/world/south-korea-martial-law)). The resolution was passed with overwhelming support—190 out of 300 members voted in favor—illustrating the bipartisan discontent with the president's decision.

In response to mounting pressure both domestically and internationally, President Yoon revoked the martial law decree early on December 4, 2024 ([Yonhap News](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20241204001651315)). The swift reversal has not quelled public anger or opposition demands; instead, it has intensified calls for his resignation and potential impeachment. Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung condemned the martial law as "illegal and unconstitutional," urging citizens to defend democracy ([AP News](https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-martial-law-997c22ac93f6a9bece68454597e577c1)).

Internationally, the decision to lift martial law was met with relief. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed the development, emphasizing the importance of resolving political issues through peaceful and lawful means ([DW News](https://www.dw.com/en/south-korean-lawmakers-reject-martial-law/video-70950789)).

Economically, the South Korean finance ministry took immediate action to stabilize markets rattled by the crisis. Measures included injecting liquidity into stocks, bonds, and foreign exchange markets to mitigate financial volatility ([Yonhap News](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20241204001651315)).

As South Korea navigates this period of political upheaval, the swift reaction from its democratic institutions underscores a robust commitment to constitutional governance. However, with looming impeachment proceedings and public dissent, the nation faces significant challenges in restoring political stability.
