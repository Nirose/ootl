title: 'Vivaldi tests new approach to Ad Attribution: Tracking intentional clicks only'
---

Vivaldi has always prided itself on providing a unique browsing experience in a world where online privacy and user choice are dwindling. The browser, known for its customizable features, has taken a firm stance against intrusive tracking while acknowledging the necessity of advertising in sustaining many web services. Recently, however, Vivaldi has found itself at a crossroads, leading to a crucial shift in how it handles ad attribution.

## The Challenge: Balancing Privacy with Revenue

Vivaldi's built-in ad and tracker blocker was designed to give users control over their online experience. With three levels of blocking—no blocking, blocking trackers (but allowing ads), and blocking both trackers and ads—the browser aimed to protect users from unwanted surveillance while still allowing them the option to support their favorite websites through ads. However, as the ad landscape evolved, Vivaldi began to face declining revenue from its search partners, revealing a significant flaw in its approach.

By blocking trackers indiscriminately, Vivaldi inadvertently hindered the effectiveness of ad attribution—an essential mechanism that ensures advertisers know which ads lead to conversions. Without this feedback loop, search partners could not accurately track ad performance, resulting in reduced revenue for Vivaldi.

## A Practical Solution: Tracking Intentional Clicks Only

To address the revenue shortfall while maintaining its commitment to user privacy, Vivaldi is testing a new solution that activates ad attribution only when users intentionally click on an ad. This change will initially roll out in Vivaldi's Snapshot builds, allowing the company to evaluate its effectiveness without impacting users of the stable version.

When a user clicks on an ad displayed in search results from partner engines like StartPage or DuckDuckGo, Vivaldi will permit limited ad attribution scripts to load on the landing page. If no ad is clicked, the attribution process will not occur, effectively preserving user privacy while re-establishing necessary revenue streams.

## How It Will Work: User Control at the Forefront

For users concerned about ads or tracking, Vivaldi offers an option to disable this completely. Those who prefer to block ads entirely can easily adjust their settings:

### For Desktop:

1. Open Settings > Privacy and Security > Tracker and Ad Blocking.
2. Select Block Trackers and Ads.
3. Go to Manage Sources.
4. In Ad Blocking Sources, uncheck Allow ads from our partners.

### For Android:

1. Open Settings from the Vivaldi menu.
2. Select Tracker and Ad Blocking.
3. Choose Manage Ad Blocking Sources.
4. Uncheck Allow ads from our partners.

Currently, iOS users do not have ad attribution implemented, but they can also disable ads on partner search engines via similar steps.

## A Vision for the Future

Vivaldi's approach reflects a broader mission to ensure that the open web remains accessible and equitable for all users. By striking a balance between necessary ad revenue and user privacy, Vivaldi aims to prevent the retreat of online services behind paywalls—an outcome that could severely limit access for those unable or unwilling to pay.

As Vivaldi continues to refine its ad blocker with aspirations of matching feature parity with industry standards like uBlock Origin, it emphasizes the importance of contextual advertising that respects user privacy without compromising website funding.

In a digital landscape fraught with challenges, Vivaldi’s willingness to adapt while standing firm on privacy principles showcases its commitment to creating a better web experience—one where user choice truly reigns supreme.
