The Intel Arc B580, part of the new "Battlemage" series, has been announced. Here are some key points about the Intel Arc B580 based on the available information:

## Hardware Specifications

- The Arc B580 features 20 Xe cores, which is the full complement for the Battlemage series.
- It has a graphics clock speed of 2670MHz.
- The card is equipped with 12GB of GDDR6 video memory and a 192-bit GDDR6 video memory interface.
- The total board power rating is 190 Watts, and it requires one 8-pin PCI Express power connector.

## Performance Improvements

- Intel claims up to a 70% improvement in performance per Xe core and up to a 50% improvement in performance per Watt compared to the previous Alchemist series.

## Market Positioning

- The Arc B580 is positioned as a mid-range graphics card, primarily aimed at 1440p gaming. It does not have a higher-tier counterpart like the Arc A770 in the previous generation.

## Linux Support

- The Battlemage series, including the Arc B580, will have full open-source graphics driver support on Linux. This includes support from the Xe kernel driver, Mesa Iris OpenGL, ANV Vulkan drivers, and the Intel Compute Runtime stack for OpenCL and Level Zero. The card is expected to work well with the stable Linux 6.12 kernel and the latest Mesa graphics drivers.

## Pricing and Availability

- The Intel Arc B580 will be available for shipping next week, priced at $249+ USD.

## Benchmarks and Comparisons

- While detailed performance benchmarks are not yet available due to the review embargo, Intel has promoted the Arc B580 as being 24% faster than the Intel Arc A750 and 10% faster than the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 in Windows benchmarks.

For a comprehensive review, including detailed performance benchmarks and Linux-specific support details, users will need to wait until the review embargo is lifted and Phoronix publishes their in-depth analysis.
