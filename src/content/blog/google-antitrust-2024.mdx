# Google's US antitrust Trial

The article discusses the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)'s efforts to address Google's search monopoly through potential remedies, including the controversial proposal to force Google to sell its Chrome browser. The DOJ aims to restore competition in the search engine market after a long-running antitrust case against Google, which has been accused of maintaining illegal monopolies in search services and advertising.

Key points include:

1. Court Proceedings: The first phase of the trial focused on whether Google is liable for antitrust harms, with Judge Amit Mehta indicating that Google is indeed an illegal monopolist in general search services.
2. Proposed Remedies: The DOJ's proposals could significantly impact Google's core business. They include:

- Selling Chrome, which could limit Google’s ability to control access to its search engine.
- Preventing Google from preferentially promoting its own services on platforms like Android.

1. Impact of Selling Chrome:

- There are concerns about who would buy Chrome and how it would affect competition.
- Potential buyers could include tech companies or even large language model firms, but there are risks regarding market dynamics.

1. Data Syndication: A major proposal involves requiring Google to syndicate its search results and query data to competitors at marginal cost, which could enhance competition by leveling the playing field.
2. Exclusionary Contracts: The DOJ seeks to ban Google from entering into exclusive contracts that secure its default placement in browsers and devices, which could alter the competitive landscape.
3. Transparency for Advertisers: The DOJ is also pushing for greater transparency for advertisers regarding ad performance and targeting options.
4. Android's Status: Notably, the DOJ did not propose selling Android, though it remains a critical access point for Google's services.

Overall, while these measures aim to foster competition in the search engine market, there are significant implications for Google's business model and the broader tech industry.

## DOJ's Case

### DOJ proposing forced sale of Google Chrome for $20 billion

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is considering a forced sale of Google Chrome, which could potentially generate $20 billion if approved by a judge. This move is part of ongoing antitrust litigation against Google, with concerns that its dominance in the web browser market stifles competition. The DOJ's proposal reflects increasing scrutiny of big tech companies, aiming to address monopolistic practices. The final decision will depend on the court's ruling on the matter.

## Google's Rebuttal

### Google's US antitrust trial over online ad empire draws to a close

The U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) has accused Google of illegally dominating online advertising technology during a recent antitrust trial. Closing arguments were made in Alexandria, Virginia, after a 15-day trial where prosecutors sought to prove that Google monopolized publisher ad servers, advertiser ad networks, and ad exchanges. DOJ lawyer Aaron Teitelbaum claimed that "Google rigged the rules of the road" and referred to it as a repeated monopolist.

In contrast, Google’s lawyer, Karen Dunn, argued that the DOJ failed to meet its legal burden and claimed that the online advertising market is competitive. She accused the DOJ of cherry-picking data and ignoring legitimate business practices by Google.

Witnesses testified that publishers felt unable to switch away from Google due to its dominance in ad demand, with some estimating significant revenue losses if they did so. If Judge Leonie Brinkema finds Google guilty of antitrust violations, she may consider forcing the company to sell off its Google Ad Manager.

Although the DOJ is pursuing this case, analysts believe it poses a smaller financial risk compared to another significant case where Google was found to have an illegal monopoly in online search.

### Google asks US appeals court to reject app store monopoly verdict

Google has requested a U.S. appeals court to overturn a previous ruling that found the company guilty of maintaining a monopoly in the app store market. The ruling was part of a broader legal battle concerning app distribution and competition. Google argues that the decision could negatively impact consumers and developers by disrupting the current app ecosystem. The company contends that its practices foster competition rather than stifle it, and it is seeking to have the ruling set aside in order to avoid potential changes to its business operations.
