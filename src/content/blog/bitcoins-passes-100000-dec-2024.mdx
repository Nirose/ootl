title: "Bitcoin's Ascent to $100,000: A Triumph Fueled by Trump's Crypto Embrace"
---

Bitcoin, the world's leading cryptocurrency, shattered the $100,000 barrier on Thursday, December 4th, 2024. This momentous occasion, eagerly anticipated by crypto enthusiasts, marks a significant milestone in the history of Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency's price has been on a remarkable upward trajectory throughout 2024, soaring over 126% since January. A confluence of factors has contributed to this surge, with the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president playing a pivotal role.

## Crypto-Friendly Policies Spark Bitcoin Rally

Trump's pro-crypto stance has injected optimism into the cryptocurrency market. His campaign pledge to establish the United States as the "bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world," along with his appointment of crypto advocate Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has fueled expectations of a favorable regulatory landscape for digital assets. This shift in sentiment, contrasting with the stricter approach of the previous administration, has emboldened investors to embrace Bitcoin.

Atkins, a former SEC commissioner and co-chairman of the Digital Chamber of Commerce, is widely perceived as a champion of the cryptocurrency industry. His anticipated leadership of the SEC has led to projections of a more accommodating regulatory environment, potentially removing hurdles that hindered the industry's growth under the previous administration.

## The Impact of Trump's Election on Bitcoin

Since Trump's election victory on November 5th, Bitcoin's price has surged by approximately 45%, driven by a wave of capital flowing into U.S. Bitcoin-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This institutional interest, coupled with Trump's vocal support for cryptocurrency, propelled Bitcoin's price beyond the $100,000 mark, reaching an all-time high of $104,000.

The surge in Bitcoin's price is particularly pronounced during U.S. trading hours, suggesting a strong correlation between investor sentiment and Trump's crypto-friendly policies.

## Analysts React to Bitcoin's Historic Milestone

Reactions to Bitcoin's historic achievement have varied widely:

- Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at AJ Bell in London, acknowledged the significance of the $100,000 milestone but cautioned against interpreting it as Bitcoin going mainstream. He emphasized that Bitcoin remains a high-risk asset characterized by volatility and speculation.
- Chang Wei Liang, an FX and credit strategist at DBS in Singapore, expressed optimism about Bitcoin's future prospects, suggesting that crypto adoption may be reaching a tipping point in the U.S. under the Trump administration.
- Shoki Omori, Chief Japan Desk Strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo, attributed Bitcoin's surge to the anticipation of a less aggressive regulatory approach under Atkins' leadership of the SEC.
- Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE in Hong Kong, described Bitcoin's breakthrough as a "pivotal moment" for the cryptocurrency industry, predicting further institutional investment and a new wave of adoption.
- Geoff Kendrick, Global Head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered in London, noted that approximately 3% of Bitcoin's total supply had been acquired by institutional investors in 2024.
- Tony Sycamore, an analyst at IG in Sydney, predicted a continuation of Bitcoin's upward momentum, forecasting it to reach $120,000 in 2025.
- Kyle Rodda, Senior Financial Market Analyst at Capital.com in Melbourne, viewed the $100,000 milestone as evidence of Bitcoin's growing legitimacy. He cited factors such as reduced regulatory risk and heightened geopolitical risks as potential tailwinds for Bitcoin's continued ascent.
- Justin D'Anethan, an independent crypto analyst based in Hong Kong, interpreted Bitcoin's surge as a reflection of shifting trends in finance and technology.
- Bobby Ong, co-founder of CoinGecko in Kuala Lumpur, described Bitcoin's milestone as a testament to the cryptocurrency market's increasing maturity and mainstream adoption.
- Shane Oliver, Chief Economist and Head of Investment Strategy at AMP in Sydney, acknowledged Bitcoin's emerging role as a store of value within the financial landscape.
- Ray Attrill, Head of FX Research at NAB in Sydney, cautioned about Bitcoin's speculative nature and the potential impact of a significant stock market correction on its value.
- Richard Teng, CEO of Binance in Dubai, hailed Bitcoin's achievement as a landmark moment and expressed confidence in its imminent mainstream adoption.
- Jean-Baptiste Graftieux, CEO of Bitstamp in Luxembourg, anticipated broader integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial systems.

Bitcoin's surge to $100,000 is a remarkable feat propelled by multiple factors, including Donald Trumpâ€™s pro-crypto policies and a broader shift in investor sentiment. While some remain cautious about its future trajectory, Bitcoin's resilience and growing acceptance within the financial landscape suggest it is here to stay. The long-term impact of this milestone remains to be seen, but it marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of cryptocurrency.
