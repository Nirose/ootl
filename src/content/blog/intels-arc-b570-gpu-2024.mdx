In the fast-evolving world of PC gaming, anticipation is building around Intel's upcoming Arc B570 GPU, set to launch on December 3rd. Recent leaks have shed light on impressive specifications that suggest this entry-level graphics card could be a formidable contender in the market.

According to reliable leaker [Roland Quandt](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qicvhaddltmw5jeupfi73dqu), the Arc B570 will feature 18 Xe2 cores and 10GB of GDDR6 VRAM, paired with a 160-bit memory bus. With a clock speed of up to 2.6GHz, this GPU promises to deliver a smooth gaming experience, capable of handling modern titles with ease. Additionally, it will come equipped with an 8-pin PCIe power connector and support for both HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 2.1, ensuring compatibility with the latest display technologies.

## Key Specs:

- Core Configuration: 18 Xe2 cores
- Memory: 10GB GDDR6
- Memory Bus: 160-bit
- Clock Speed: Up to 2.6GHz
- Power Connector: 8-pin PCIe
- Display Outputs: HDMI 2.1 & DisplayPort 2.1

The Arc B570 is designed to rival affordable options like the Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti and AMD Radeon RX 7600, making it an attractive choice for gamers on a budget. Early product listings suggest a price point of around $250, which is significantly less than its competitors—$399 for the RTX 4060 Ti and $269 for the RX 7600.

But the excitement doesn't stop there. The Arc B570’s slightly more powerful sibling, the Arc B580, is also generating buzz with its 20 Xe2 cores, 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM, and a 192-bit memory bus. This card, rumored to clock in at 2.8GHz, offers even more performance for those willing to spend a bit more.

As we count down to the launch event, Intel has confirmed that it will showcase the new Battlemage GPUs during a livestream on its YouTube channel. Gamers and tech enthusiasts alike will want to tune in to see firsthand how these new offerings stack up against the competition.

With the gaming landscape becoming increasingly competitive, Intel's Arc B570 and its variants could shift the balance in the entry-level GPU market. As always, only time will tell if these chips can deliver on their promise when they finally hit the shelves. Keep an eye out for the release; it could just be the upgrade you’ve been waiting for.
