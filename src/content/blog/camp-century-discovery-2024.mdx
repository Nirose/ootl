title: NASA's Camp Century Discovery "City Under the Ice"
---

The abandoned military site in question is Camp Century, a Cold War-era U.S. military base buried deep within the Greenland Ice Sheet. It was a military base built between 1959 and 1960, designed to support nuclear missile operations.The discovery occurred as NASA's UAVSAR (Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar) system, mounted on a Gulfstream III aircraft, scanned the ice sheet near Pituffik Space Base. The radar provides a multi-dimensional view, revealing structures within Camp Century in unprecedented detail.

While past surveys using conventional radar detected signs of the base, the UAVSAR's advanced capabilities offered a clearer image of the camp's layout. This technology, originally intended to map ice surface and layers for understanding ice sheet dynamics, revealed Camp Century unexpectedly.

Cryospheric scientist Chad Greene expressed surprise at the find, emphasizing that the mission's primary goal was to evaluate UAVSAR's potential for mapping ice sheets. The data promises to enhance future research in Antarctica and Greenland.

The discovery has renewed interest in assessing when melting ice might re-expose Camp Century, raising concerns about buried biological, chemical, and radioactive waste. As scientists continue to analyze the UAVSAR data, this serendipitous glimpse into history underscores the evolving challenges and opportunities in polar research.

Images supporting this discovery were provided by NASA Earth Observatory contributors Michala Garrison and Jesse Allen, using data from Chad Greene and Joseph MacGregor. Historical imagery comes courtesy of the National Archives.

## Discovery and Location

California-based scientists with NASA, including Chad Greene and Alex Gardner from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), accidentally discovered the remains of Camp Century during a geological research mission in April 2024. The site was identified using Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) attached to a Gulfstream III aircraft.

## History and Purpose

Camp Century was constructed between June 1959 and October 1960 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It was part of Project Iceworm, a secret plan to deploy nuclear intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) aimed at the Soviet Union. The base was designed to house up to 200 soldiers and scientists and included various facilities such as housing, a theater, gym, post exchange, library, and a chapel. The base was powered by a PM-2A portable nuclear reactor.

## Abandonment and Current State

The base was abandoned in 1967 due to the failure of Project Iceworm and the challenges of maintaining the tunnels in the shifting ice sheet. When the base was closed, the nuclear reactor was removed, but significant amounts of nuclear waste, diesel fuel, and biological waste were left behind. The site is now buried approximately 100 feet deep in the ice.

## Environmental Concerns

The abandonment of Camp Century has left behind substantial environmental hazards. The site contains over 47,000 gallons of low-level radioactive waste, 53,000 gallons of diesel fuel, and 6.3 million gallons of wastewater, including sewage. Climate change poses a significant risk as the thawing of the Greenland Ice Sheet could lead to the release of these contaminants into the environment, potentially contaminating ancient ice and marine ecosystems.

## Scientific Significance

Despite its abandonment, Camp Century remains a significant site for scientific research. The original ice core drilling conducted at the base contributed to modern climate models. Current studies on the site help scientists understand the impact of climate change on the Greenland ice sheet and the potential risks associated with buried contaminants.
